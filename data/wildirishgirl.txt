I am jealous only on furmife ; but who was 
ever jealous on conviftion ; for where is the 
heart fo weak^ fo mean, as to cherilh the 
paflion when betrayed by the objeft ? I have 
already mentioned to you the incongruities 
which fo forcibly ftrucfc me in Glorvina's 
iotidoir. Since the evening, the happy 
evening in which I firft vifited it, I have often 
Holen thither when I knew her elfewhere 
engaged, but always found it locked till this 
morning, when I perceived the door (land- 
ing open. It feemed as though its miftrefs 
had but juft left it, for a chair was placed 
jiear the window, which was open, and her 
hook and work-bafket lay on the. feat. I 
mechanically took up the book ; it was my 
own, Eloifay and was marked with a flip of 
paper in that page where the charafter of 
Wolmar is defcribed. I read through the 
paflage, and was throwing'the book by when 
feme writing on the paper mark caught my^ 
eye; fuppofing it to* be Glorvina's, I en- 
deavoured to decipher the lines, and read 
» follows : '^ Pro£e£Bons,' my lovely friend.

it could not be her father's. And yet, I 
thought the hand was not entirely unknown'

ftood, and faid in the language of St. Preuk^ 
^' The world in my imagination is > divided

With an air of bewitching infinuation fhe 
placed her hand on my fhoulder, and, with 
a faint blufh and a little fmile, fhook her

honoured, and £ud» ^^ profeflions, my lovely

doubtedly the fame hand, that made the 
offering of the vafes, prefented alfo thofe 
other portable elegancies which are fo 
ftrongly contrafted by the, rude original fur- 
niture of the boudoir. The tafteful doneur^ 
and the author of that letter whofe torn frag- 
ment betrayed, the fentiment of no common 
mind, are certainly one and the fame per- 
ion. Yet who vifits the caftle ? -— fcarcely 
any one ; the« pride and ciranpflances of the 
Prince equally forbid it. Sometimes, though 
rarely, an old Milefian coufin or poor relsu 
tion will drop in, but thofe of them that I 
have feeh are mere common pilaice people. 
I have indeed heard the Printe fpeak of a 
coufin in the Spaniih fervice, and a nephew 
in the Iriih brigades, now in Germany ; but 
the coufin is an old man, and he has not 
feen the nephew fince he was a child. Yet 
after all, thefe prefents may have come from 
<me of thefe relatives ; iffo, as Glorvina has 
no recolledion of either, how I fhould 
curfe that jealous temper which has pur- 
chafed for me fome moments of torturing

doubts ! I remember you ufed often to fa;^, 
that any woman could pique me into Jove by 
aSe£ling indifference, and that the native 
jealoufy of my difpoiition would always 
render me the flave of any woman who 
knew how to play on my dominant pafHon^ 
The hdi is, when my heart ereds an idbt 
for its iecret homage, it is madnefs to think 
that another ihould even bow zt the ihrine^ 
much lefs that his offerings (bould be pro*»

But it is the fiknce of Gtcnrvma on the

it is lactilege sgaihft heaven to doubt her --*

LETTER XXV. 
TO J. D. ESQ- M. P. 

JUST as I had finiflied my laft, the Prince 
fent for me to his roonx ; I found him 
alone^ and fitting up in his bed I He only 
•complained of the effecls of years and fick- 
nefs, but it was evident feme recent caufe 
of uneafineTs preyed on his mind. ' He made 
me fit by his .^bed-fide,, and (aid,, that m.y 
goad*nature upon every occafion induced 
him to prefer a requefty he was induced. to 
hope would not meet with a denial. I beg- 
ged he would change that requeft to a OMn-* 
mand, and rely in, every inftance, on my 
readinefs to> ferve him. He thanked and 
told me' in a &w words, that the prieft was 
going on a very particular, but not very 
pleafing, bufinefs for him (the Prince) to 
the nartb ; that the journey was long, and- 
would be both folitary and tedious to his. 



THE WILD IRISH Gl]pL. . ^ 

good old friend, whofe health I might liave 
obferved was delicate and precarious, except 
I had the goodnefs to cheat the wearinefs of 
the journey by giving the prieft my com- 
pany. ** I would not make the requeft," 
he added, ^^ but that I think your com- 
plknce will be produ^ve of pleafure and 
information to yourfelf ; in a journey of $ 
hundred miles, many new fources of ob« 
fervation to your inquirmg mind will appear. 
Befides, you who feem to feel fo lively an 
interefl in all which concerns this country, 
will be glad to have an opportunity of vie w- 
ing the Irifli charafter in a new afpeft ; or 
rather of beholding the Scotch charafter 
engrafted upon o«rs* '^ But,*' feid the 
Prince, with his ufual nationality, *^ that 
exotic branches very diftinguiOiable from the 
old ftock/' 

I need not tell you that I complied with 
thisrequeft mth/eeming readinefs, but with 
real reludance. 

In the evening, as we circled round the 
,fire in the great hall, I propofed to Father

John to accompany him on his journey the 
following day. The poor man was overjoyed 
at the offer, while Glorvina betrayed nekher 
furprife nor regret at my intention, but 
looked firft at her^ father, and then at oie, 
with kindnefs and gratitude. 

Were my heart more at eafe, were my 
confidence in the affedionsof Glorvina fome» 
thing ftronger, I (hould greatly relifh this 
little tour ; but as it is, when I found every 
thing arranged for my departure, without 
the concurrence of my own wifhes, I could 
not check my pettiffmefs, and for want of 
fome other mode of venting it, I endeavoured 
to ridicule a work on the fubjed of ancient 
Irijh hiftory, which the prieft was reading 
aloud, while Glorvina worked, and I was 
trifling with my pencil. 

** What," faid I, after having interrupted 
him in many different paflages, which I 
thought .favoured of national hyperbole^ 
*^ what can be more forced than that very 
fuppofition of your partial author, that 
Albiony the mofl ancient name of Britaiiiy

moFogy/* faid the prieft, " yet it has the 
&ndion of Camden^ who &ft riiked the fup« 
pofition. But it is the fate of our unhappy 
cDuiKry to receive as little credit in the pre- 
fent day for its former celebrity, as for it$ 
great antiquity*, although the former is 
attefted by Bede^i and many othar early 
Britiih writers, and the latter is authenticated 

* It has been tbefafhion to throw an odium on the 
modern Irifh^by undermining the bails of their ancient 
hiRory, and vilifying their ancient national charadter* 
If an hiilorian profeiTes to have acquired his informa* 
tion from the records of the country, whofe hillory he 
writes, his accounts are generally admitted as authen- 
tic, as the commentaries of Garcilorffo de Vega are 
eonfidered as the chief pillars of Peruvian hiftbry, ^ 
though avowed by their author to have been compiled 
from the old national ballads of the country ; yet the 
old writers of Ireland, (the pfalter of Caihel in par« 
ticular) though they refer to thofe ancient records of 
ihetr country, authenticated by exifting manners and 
ntiding habits, are plunged into the oblivion of con--

* To cndeaTour to efface from the Irifti chara^er 
the odium of cruelty, by which the venom of preju-

retrace a feries of complicated events from the firft 
period of Britifh invafion to a recent day ; and by the 
txpofition of CAUSES accomplifh the extenuation of 
EFFECTS. To fuch a talk neither the limits of this 
little work, nor the abilities of its author, are compe- 
tent ; much indeed has been already faid, and finely 
^id, on the fubje6t by thofe whofe powers were ade* 
quate to the tafk, and who were induced by the mere 
principle of national affedtion to the .nobler effort of 
national defence. But the champions were Iri/hmetti 
and the motive of the patriotic exertion became its fole

Had the Hiftoriographer of Montezuma or 
Ataliba defended the rejtftancg of his countrymen) 
or recorded the woes fr6m whence it fprangi though 
his QUI PAS were bathed in their blood, or embued

TO J. D. ESQ. M. P. 

r^AN you reGolleft who was that rational, 
moderate youth who exclaimed in the 
phrenzy of paffion, ^^ O Gods ! annihilate 
both time and fpace^ and make two lovers 
happy.** 

For my part^ I ihould indeed wifh the 
hours annihilated till I again behold Glor-

were requifite I ihould be fifty miles from 
her, to be more entirely with her, to ap- 
preciate the full value of her fociety, and tq 
learn the nature of thofe wants my heart 
muft ever" feel when feparated from hen 
The prieft and I arofe this morning with the 
fun; our lovely hoftefs was ready at the 
breakfafl-table to receive us. I was fo felC- 
ifh as to obferve without regret the air of 
languor that invefled her whole form, and

the heavinefs that weighed down her eye- 
lids, as if the influence of fleep had not 
renovated the luftre of thofe downcaft eyes 
they veiled. Ah ! if I dared believe that 
thefe wakeful hours were given to me! 
But I fear at that moment her heart was 
more occupied by her father than her lover j 
for I have obferved, in a thoufand inftances, 
the intereil (he takes in his a£f^rs ; and, in-> 
deed, the prieft hinted to me, that her good 
fenfe has frequently retrieved thofe circum* 
ftances the imprudent fpeculations of her 
father have as conftantly deranged. 

During breakfafl ihe fpoke but little^ and 
once I caught her eyes turned full on me, 
with a glance in which tendemefs, regret, 
and even fomething of defpondency, were 
mingled. Glorvina defpond ! fo young, fo 
lovely, fo virtuous, and fo highly gifted ! 
Oh ! at that moment had I been mafter of 
worlds ! . But dependent myfelf on another's 
will, I could only fympathize in the fuffer* 
ings while I adored the fufFerer.

and faw her pafs the draw-bridge without a 
recolledion on her part that it was to have 
been^ the boundary of her walk. We had 
not, however, proceeded many paces, when 
the mofl wildly mournful founds I ever 
heard rofe on the air, and flowly died away. 

** Hark !" faid Glorvina, ** fome one is 
going to * that bourne from whence no 
traveller returns*^ '* As fhe fpoke, a 
hundred voices feemed to afcend to the 
ikies : and, as they fubfided, a famter ftrain 
lingered on the air, as if this truly favage 
choral fymphony was reduced to a recitative, 
chanted by female voices. All that I had 
heard of the Irijb howlj or funeral fong, now 
rufhed to my recoUedion ; and turning at 
that moment the angle of the mountain of 
Inifmore, I perceived a proceffion advancing 
towards a little cemetery, which lay by a 
narrow path-way to the left of the road. 

The body, in a plain deal coffin, covered 
with a white fliirt, was carried by four men, 
immediately preceded by feveral old women^ 
arrayed in their mantles, and who fang at

them \tralked a number of young peribns oi 
both fexes, each couple holding by a white 
handkerchief) ana ftrewing flowers along the 
path. An elderly woman, with eyes over- 
flown with tears, . diflievelled hair, and dif- 
traded mien, followed the body, uttering 
many paflionate exclamations in Irifli ; the 
proceifion was filled up by upwards of three 
hundred people, the recitative of the female 
chorifter being relieved at intervals by the 
combined bowlings of the whole body. In 
one of the paufes of this dreadful death- 
chorus, I exprefled to Glorvina my furprife 

* Speaking of the ancient Irifli funeral^ Mn Walker

might affift in heightening the melancholy which that 
ceremony was calculated to infpire. This cuftom

** The lower order of Irifh/' Ihe returned,

fpeding their funerals ; and from fentiments 
that I have heard them exprefs, I really be- 
lieve there are many among them who would 
prefer living neglefted to the idea of dying 
unmoumed, or unattended, by a hoft to their 
laft home.'* To my aftonifliment fhe then 
defcended the bank, and accompanied by the 
prieft, mingled with the crowd. 

" This will furprife you," faid Glorvina ; 
** but it is wife to comply with thofe pre- 
judices which we cannot vanquifh. And 
by thofe poor people it is not only reckoned 
a mark of great difrefpeft not to follow a 
funeral (met by chance) a few paces, but' 
almoft a fpecies of impiety." " And man-

of no country which the Irifli at prefent re- 
femble but the modem Greeks. In both 
countries, when the deceafed dies unmarried, 
the young attendants are chiefly drefled in 
white, carrying garlands, and ftrewing 
flowers as they proceed to the grave. Thofe 
old women who iing before the body are 
profeflional improvifatori ; they are called 
Caoiners or Keeners^ from the Caoine or 
death fong, and are hired to celebrate the 
virtues of the deceafed. Thus we find St. 
Chryfoftom cenfuring the Greeks of his 
day, for the purchafed lamentations and 
hireling mourners that attended their fune«> 
rals. And fo far back with us as in the 
days of druidical influence, we find it was 
part of the profeflion of the bards to perform 
their funeral ceremonies, to fing to theiy 
harps the virtues of the dead, and to call on

the living to emulate the deeds •. This yon 
may remember is a cuftom frequently al- 
luded to in the poems of Offian t» Pray ob- 

* The Coiorie or funeral fong, was eompofed by the 
File of the departed, fet to mufic by one of his oir- 
fidegh, and fung over the grave by the racafaide or 
rhapfodift, who accompanied his "fong of the tomb'^ 
with the mourning mr.rmur of his harp, while the 
inferior order of minftrcis at intervals mingled their 
deep-toned chorus with the lirain of grief, and the 
fighs of lamenting relatives breathed in iinifun to the 
tuneful forrow- Thus was " the Hones of his fame"' 
raifed over the remains of the Irifh chief with a cere- 
mony refembling that with which the death of the 
Trojan hero was lamented s 

^ A melancholy choir attend around. 

With plaintive fighs and mufic's folemn found." 

But the iingular ceremonies of the Iri/h funeral, 
which are even flill in a certain degree extant, may be 
traced to a remoter antiquity than Grecian origin f 
for the pathetic lamentations of David for the friend 
of his foul, and the conclamatio breathed over the 
Phcenician Dido, has no faint coincidence to the 
Coioneox funeral fong of the Irifh.^ 

•|- Thus over the tomb of Cueullin vibrated the 
fong of the bard ;— " Bleft be thy foul, foA of Semo \ 
Thou wert mighty in battle, thy ftrength was like

ftand the nature of her lamentations, you 
would compare them to the complaints of

They even ftill moft religioufly preferve

^^ A'wake^ as it is called among us,'' he 
replied, ^^ is at once the feafon of lamenta-^ 
tion and forrow, and of feafting and amufe* 
nient. The immediate relatives of the 
deceafed fit near the bady, devoted to all the 
luxury of woe, which revives into the moft 
piercing lamentations at the entrance of 
every ftranger, while the friends, acquain- 
tanceSj and guefts, give themfelves up to a 
variety of amufements ; feats of dexterity, 
and even fome exquifite pantomimes, are 
performed ; yet in the midft of all their 
games, fhould any one pronounce an Ave 
Maria^ the merry group are in a moment 
on their knees, and the devotional impulfe 
being gratified, they recommence their 
fports with new vigour. The wakcj how- 
ever, is of fhort duration ; for here, as in 
Greece, it is thought an injuftice to the dead 
to keep them long above ground; hence 
interment ' follows death with all poflible 
expedition/' 

We had now reached the burial ground, ' 
near which the funeral was met by the

the garland at the fame moment, and, tak-

Glorvina took from it a fprig of rofemary — 
its leaves were humid ! ** It is not all dew,'* 
faid Glorvina with a fad fmile, while her

And with him only could I, without mad- 
nefs, fhare the tender^ fenfible, angelic heart 
of this fweet interefting being. 

Obferving her emotion increafe, as (he 
ftood near the fpot facred to filial grief, 
I endeavoured to draw away her attention 
by remarking, that almoil every tomb had 
now a votarift. " It is a ftrong inftatice,** 
faid Glorvina, " of the fenfibility of the 
Irifh, that they repair at intervals to the 
tombs of their deceafed friends, to drop a 
tender tear, or heave a heart-breathed figh, 
to the memory of thofe fo lamented in 
death, fo dear to them in life. For my 
own part, in the (lillnefs of a fine evening, 
I often wander towards this folemn fpot, 
where the flowers, newly throvm on the 
tombs, and weeping with the tears of de- 
parted day, always fpeak to my heart a tale 
of woe it feels and underftands. While,

as'the breeze of evening mourns foftly round

We were (landing in a remote part of

In the fucceeding moments I know not

Our horfes now coming up to the gate of

the cemetery, we infifted on walking back 
as far as the draw-bridge with Glorvina. 
When we reached it, the prieft faluted her 
cheek with paternal freedom, and gave her 
his bleiling. I was put off with an offer of

no longer envied the prieft his cold falute ;

unreciprocated. Reverberated blifs alone 
can touch the heart. 

When we had parted with Glorvina^ and 
caught a laft view of her receding figure, 
we mounted our horfes, and proceeded a 
confiderable way in filence. The morning, 
though fine, was gloomy ; and, though the 
fun was fcarcely an hour high, we were met 
by innumerable groups of peafantry of both

as the men cut the turf, few the potatoes, 
and even affift to cultivate the land ; both 
rife with the fun to their daily labour ; but 
his repofe brings not theirs j for, after having 
worked all day for a very trivial remunera-

pleafure derived from the contemplation

" Is it not extraordinary,** faid I, as we 
loitered over the ruins of an abbey, " that, 
though your country was fo long before the

^ transfer of property from one opulent eccle*

between the luxurious abbot of other times, 
and the rich church dignitary of the pre* 
fent, lies in a few fpeculative theories which, 
whether they are or are not confonant to 
reafon and common fenfe, have certainly 
no connexion with true religion or true mo» 
rality. Thus the biQiopricks now, like the

profit gained to the temporal^ than the 
harveft reaped to the heavenly Lord. How«

other part of Europe. St. Columbkill, and 
his cotemporaries, alone ereded in this 
kingdom upwards of 200 abbeys, if their 
biographers are to be credited; and the

their power and number.

Already weary of a converfation in which

Glorvina. 

In the courfe of the evening we arrived at 
the houfe of our deftined hoft. Although 
it was late, the family had not yet gone to 
dinner, as the fervant who took our horfes 
informed us that his mafter had but that

fcafcely reached the hall, when the report of 
our arrival having preceded our appearance, 
the whole family rufhed out to receive us.

The prieft, according to the good old 
Iriih fafliion, fainted the cheeks of the 
ladies, and had his hands nearly fhaken off 
by the men ; while I was received with all 
the cordiality that could be laviihed on a 
friend, and all the politenefs that could be

evei^y eye ; ten thoufand welcomes echoed

open for the benefit of receiving the com- 
bined efforts of a very indifferent fiddler 
and a tolerable piper, who, however, feemed 
to hold the life and fpirits of the femiVy in

fcale of the thermometer, fhould betray, by 
degrees, the expanfion or contraftion of the 
feelings, as they are warmed by emotion or 
chilled by indifference. They ihould breathe 
the foul in order to win it. 

Nothing could be more animated yet

charming girls; nor Ihould I require any 
ftronger proof of that pure and exquifite 
chaftity of charafter, which, from the earlieft

on account of various impq/Jibiltties. Here is my 

areport—- 

** Dennis Hampfon, or the man with two heads, 
i$ a native df Ctaigmore, near Garvagh, county 
Derry ; his father, Bryan Darrogher (blackifh com- 
plexion) Hampfon, held the whole town-land of Tyr- 
crevan ; his mother's relations were in poflefiion of 
the wood town (both confiderable farms in Magilli- 
gan). He loft his fight at the age of three years by 
the fmall-pox ; at twelve years he began to learn the 
harp under Bridget O'Cahan : *' For,'' as he faid, 
f' in thofe old times, women as well as men were 
taught the Iri(h harp in the beft families, and every 
old Irifh family had harps in plenty." His next 
mafter was John C. Garragher, a blind travelling 
harper, whom he followed to Buncranagh, where his 
mafter ufed to play for Colonel Vaughan : he had 
afterwards Laughlin Hanning and Pat Connor in fuc- 
ceffion as mafters. 

«* All thcfe were from Connaught, which was," as 
he added, ** the beft part of the kingdom for Irifh 
mufic and for harpers." At eighteen years of age he 
began to play for himfelf, and was taken into the 
houfe of Counfellor Canning, at Garvagh, for half a

ten years through Ireland and Scotland^ and teHs

others, that> in paffing near the place of Sir J. Camp«> 
bell, at Aghanbrack, he learned, .that this gentknmn 
had fpent a great deal, and was living on fo much per 
week of allowance. Hampfon through delicacy would 
not call, but fome of the domeftics were fent after 
him ; on coming into the caftle, Sir J. afked him why 
he bad not called, adding, ** Sir, there was never a 
harper but yourfi^f that pafled the door of my father'js 
*houfe ;" to which Hampfon anfwered that, ^* he had 
heard in the neighbourhood that his honour wa^ not 
often at home ;'' with which delicate evs£on vSir J. 
was fatisfied. He adds, ** that this was the high^ft 
bred and ilatelieft man he ever knew ; if he were put- 
ting on a new pair of gloves, and one of then^ropped 
on the floor (though ever fo clean), he would order 
the fervant to bring him another pair.^' He fays that, 
in that time he never met but one laird that had a 
harp, and that was a very fmall one, played on for- 
merly by the laird's father $ that, when he had tuned 
it vnth new firings, the laird and his lady both were

great deal of comic relifh. When he was playing at 
the houfe, a meifage came that a large party of gen-

diftrefs turned to her hu/band, faying, ** What (hall

Mr. Bunton, the celebrated mufician of that town,

allay that burning impatience which fired^ 
my bofom to return to Glorvina, after the

already left his apartment, and as I turned 
from the door to feek him, I perceived a 
written paper lying on the floor. I took it 
up and, carelefsly gfimcing my eye over it, 
difcovered that it was a receipt from the 
Princess inexorable creditor, who (as Father 
John informed me) refafed to take the Sum*

mentioned, and given in lieu of the rent for 
that very iarm by which the Prince was fo 
materiany injured* The blood boiled in 
my veins. I could have annihilated this 
rafcally cold-hearted landlord ; I could have 
wept on the neck of the unfortunate Prince; 
I could have fallen at the feet of Glorvina> 
and worfliipped her as the firft of the 
Almighty's works ! Never, in the midft of 
all my artificial wants, my boundlefs and 
craving extravagance, did I ever feel the 
want of riches as at this moment, when a 
fmall part of what I had fo worthlefsly flung 
away would have (aved the pride of a noble, 
an indignant, fpirit from a deep and deadly 
wound, and fpared the heart of filial fo- 
Hcitude and tender fenfibility many a pang 
of tortured feelings. The rent of the iarm 
was a hundred pounds per annum. The 
Prince, I uiiderftood, was three years in 
arrear ; yet, though there were no diamonds^ 
and not many pearls, I fliould fuppofe the

While I flood burning with indignation^ 
^e paper ftill trembling in my hand, I 
heard the footftep of the priefl. I let fall 
dte pq)er; he adranced, fnatched it up, 
and put it into his pocket book, with an air 
of felf-reprehenfion that determined me to 
conceal the knowledge fo accidentally ac* 
quired. Having left our adieus for our 
courteous hofts with one of the young men, 
we at laft fet out for Inifmore. The idea of 
fo foon meeting my foul's precious Gtorvina,

of the ruftic cemetery. 

Already I beheld the " air-lifted** figure 
of Glorvina floating towards me. Already 
I felt her foft hands tremble in mine, and 
gazed on the deep fuffufion of her kindling 
blufhes, the ardent welcome of her bafliful 
eyes, and all that diflblving and impaffiohed 
languor with which fte woiild refign herfelf 
to the fweet abandonment of her foul's 
chaftened tendemefs, and the fulleft confi- 
dence in that adoridg heart which had now 
unequivocally aflured her of its homage and 
eternal fealty. In ftort, I had refolved to 
confefs my name and rank to Olorvina, to 
offer her my hand, and to truft to the 
affedion of our fond and indulgent fathers 
for forgivenefs. 

Thus warmed by the vifions of my heated 
fancy, I could no longer ftifle my impa« 
dence ; and, when we were within feven 
nules of the caftle, I told the prieft, who was 
ambling llowly on, that I would be his

penfive love, wiUi a beating heart and noife*

Glorvina was feated at a table, and appa*

^t iaft I obtained from her almolt unawares 
to herfelfy the folloyring particulars : 

On a ftormy nighty in the fpring of 1 7—*^ 
dtirii^ that &tal period when the fcarcely 
dcaprifed wpunds of this unhappy country 
bled afrefli beneath the uplifted fword of 
civil contention ; when the bonds of human 
amity were rent afunder, and every man re- 
garded his neighbour with fufpicion, or con* 
iidered him with f^r, a ftranger of noble 
ftature, mufBied in a long dark cloak, ap« 
peared in the great hall of Inifmore, and 
requefted an interview with the Prince. The 
Prince having retired to reft, and being then 
in an ill ftate of health, deputed his daughter 
to receive the unknown vifitant, as the prieft 
was s^fent. The ftranger was fliewn into 
an apartment adjoining the Prince's, where 
Glorvina received him, and having remained 
&r fome time with him, retired to her fa- 
therms room : and again, after a conference 
of fome minutes, returned to the idranger ^ 
whom flie condu&ed to the Prince'^ bedfide. 
On the iame night, and after the ftranger

had paffed two hours in the Prince's cham- 
ber, the nurfe received orders to prepare 
the bed and apartment which I now occu- 
py for this myfterious guefV, who £rom that 
time remained near three mondis at the 
caftle; leaving it only occafionally for a 
few days, and always departing aftd return-* 
ing under the vdl of night. 

The following fummer he repeated his. 
vifit, accompanied by thofe prefents which 
decorate Glorvina's bQudoir, except the 
carpet and vafes, which were brought 
by a perfon who difappeared as foon as he 
had left them. During both thefe vifits, he 
gave up his time chiefly to Glorvina ; read^ 
ing to her, liftening to her mufic, and walk- 
ing with her early and late, but never with- 
out the pfieft or the nurfe, and feldom dur- 
ing the day. 

In ihort, in the furor of the old woman's 
garrulity, (who however difcovered that her 
own information had not been acquired by 
the moft juftifiable means, having, ihe faid, 
by chance, overheard a converfation which

paffed between the (banger and the Prince,) 
I^found that this myfterious vifitant was 
ifome unfortunate gentleman who had at- 
tached himfelf to the rebellious fadion of 
the day. Being purfued nearly to the gates 
of the caftle of Inifmore^ he had thrown 
himfelf on^e mercy of the Prince, who^ 
with that romantic fenfe of honour which 
diftiaguiflies his chivalrous charader, had 
not violated the truft thus forced on him, 
but granted an afylum to the unfortunate 
refugee; who, by the mod prepofleffin^ 
manners and emment endowments, had 
dazzled the fancy and won the hearts of this 
unfufpedting and credulous femilyj while 
over the minds of Glorvina and her father 
he had obtained a boundlefs influence. 

The nurfe hinted that (he believed it was 
ftill unfafe for the ftranger to appear in this 
country, as he was more cautious of con- 
cealing himfelf in his laft vifit than his firft ; 
that fhe believed he lived in England; and

well enough how it was ; but there was not

His name (he did not know ; he was only 
known by the appellation of the gentle- 
man. He was not youngs but tall, and 
yery handfome. He could not fpeak Irifliy

reminded her of him, efpedally when I 
fmiled and looked down. She was not cer-

or not J but ihe believed the Prince fre- 
quently received letters from him. 

The old woman was by no means aware 
how deeply flie had been betrayed by her 
infatiate paflion of heaxing herfelf fpeak; 
while the curious and expreflive idiom of 
her native tongue gave me more infight

not fuffer him to execute. After a long

with an emotion that almoft rendered them

I therefore wrote the following lines in

fued my folitary journey. Within twelve 
miles of M. Houfe, as I reached an emi« 
nence, I again paufed to look back, and 
caught a laft view of the mountain of Inif« 
more. It feemed to fibat like a vapour on 
the horizon. I took a laft farewell of this 
almoft loved mountain, which once had 
rifen on my gaze like the Pharos to my 
haven of enjoyment; for never until this 
fad moment, had I beheld it but with 
tranfport. 

On my arrival here, I found a letter from 
my father, fimply ftating that, by the time it 
reached me, he would probably be on his 
way to Ireland, accompanied by my intended 
bride, and her father. It concluded thus : 
** In beholding you honourably and happily 
eftabliflied, thus fecure in a liberal, a noble, 
independence, the throb of inceiTant folici- 
tude you have hitherto awakened will at laft

the fufferings, the anxieties, which with all 
your native vutue and native talent, your

imprudeDce has hitherto caufed to the 
heart of an affeftionate and indulgent 
father.*' 

This letter which, even a few days back, 
would have driven me to diftradion, I now 
read with the apathy of a ftoic. It is to me 
a matter of indiflference how I am dif« 
pofed of. I have no wifh, no will of my 
own. 

To the return of that moral torpor, from 
which a late fatally cheriihed fentiment had 
roufed me, is now added the pang of my 
life's fevereft disappointment ; like the dying 
wretch who is only roufed from total infen- 
fibility by the quivering pains which, at in- 
tervals of fluttering life, fhoot through his 
languid frame.

It is two days fince I began this letter, 
yet I am ftill here ; I have not power to 
move, though I know not what fecret fpell 
detains me. But whither Ihall I go, and to

what purpofe ? The tie which once bound 
me to phyfical and moral good, to virtue 
and felicity, is broken, for ever broken ! My 
mind is changed, dreadfully changed, within 
thefe few days. I am ill too, a burning 
fever preys upon the very fprings of life ; 
all around me is folitary and defolate*. 
Sometimes my brain feems on fire, and 
hideous phantoms float before my eyes ; 
either my fenfes are difordered by indifpo- 
fition, or the hand of heaven prefies heavily 
on me. My blood rolls in torrents through 
my veins. Sometimes I think itjhould^ it 
muft^ have vent. I feel it is in vain to think 
that I (hall ever be fit for the difcharge of 
any duty in this life. I (hall hold a place in 
the creation /to which I am a di(honour. I 
(hall become a burthen to the few who 
are obliged to feel an intereft in my wel- 
fare. 

It is the duty of every one to do that 
which his fituation requires ; to ad up to 
the meafure of judgment bellowed on him 
by Frovidence. Should I continue to drag

on this load of life, it would be for its 
wretched remnant a mere animal exiftence. 
A moral death ! What ! I become again 
like the plant I tread under my feet ; en- 
dued with a vegetative eiciftence^ but defti- 
tute of all fenfation, of all feeling ! I, who 
have fo lately revelled in the pureftj wildeft

I have had a Ihort but extraordinary 
converfation with my father. Would you 
believe it ? He has for fome time back che- 
rifhed an attachment of the tendereft nature ; 
but to his heart the interefts of his children 
have ever been an objeft of the firft and 
deareft concern. Having fecured their efta- 
blifhment in life, and, as he hopes and be- 
lieves, effeded their happinefs, he now feels 
himfelf warranted in confulting his own« 
In (hort, he has given me to underftand that 
there is a probability of his marriage with a 
very amiable smd deferving perfon clofely'

The lady's name he refufed to mention, 
until every thing was finally arranged ; and 
whoever Ihe is, I fufped: her rank is inferior 
to her merits, for he faid " the world will

heart to the world's •pinion." He then 
added (but in an equivocal manner), ttuit, 
had he been able to follow me immediately 
to Ireland, as he had at firft propofed, he 
would have related to me fome circumftances 
of peculiar intereft, but that I Jhould yet 
know all ! and feemed, I thought, to lament 
that difparity of charader between my 
brother and him, which prohibited that flow 
of confidence his heart feems panting to in- 
dulge in. You know Edward takes no 
pains to conceal that he fmiles at thofe ar- 
dent virtues in his father's charader, to 
which the phlegmatic temperament of his 
own gives the name of romance* 

The two fathers fettle every thing as they 
pleafe. A property which fell to my father 
a few weeks back by the death of a rich 
maiden aunt, with every thing not entailed, 
he has made over to me even during his 
life. Expoftulation was in vain ; he would 
not hear me : for himfjslf he has retained 
nothing but his purchafed eftates in Con- 
-naught, which are infinitely more extenfive

of wounded pride fhall have fubfided ; when 
the refentments of a doating, a deceived,

will I then fubmit to the didates of an im- 
perious duty, or refign myfelf unrefifling to 
the influence of morbid apathy ? 

Sometimes my father fixes his eyes fo 
tenderly on me, yet with a look as if he 
would fearch into the moft fecret folds of 
my heart. He has never once afked my 
opinion of my elefted bride, who, gay and 
happy as the firfl circles of this difGpated 
city can make her, cheerfully receives the 
plea which my ill health affords, (attributed 
to a heavy .cold,) of not attending her in

CONCLUSION. 

A FEW days after the departure of the 

Earl of M. from Dublin, the intended 

father-in-law of his fon, weary of a town* 

life, to which he had hitherto been unac- 

cuftomed, propofed that they fhould fur- 

prife the Earl at M Houfe, without 

waiting for that f ammons which was to have 
governed their departure for Connaught. 

His young and thoughtlefs daughter, 
eager only after novelty, was charmed by a 
plan which promifed a change of fcene and 
variety of life. The unfortunate lover of 
Glorvina fancied he gave a reludant com- 
pliance to the propofal which coincided bv&t 
too clofely with the fecret defires of his foul ! 

This inconfiderate projeft was put into 
execution almoft as foon as it was formed. 
Mr. D. and his daughter went in their own 
carriage j *Mr. M. followed on horfeback. 



l6o THE WILD IRISH GIRL, 

On their arrival, they found M Houfe 

occupied by workmen of every defcription, 
and the Earl of M. abfent. Mr. Clenden- 
ning,HisLordI]iip*s agent, had not returned 
from England ; and the fteward, who had 
been but lately appointed to the office, in- 
formed the travellers that Lord M. had only 
been one day at M ■ Houfe, and had 
removed a few miles up the country to a 
hunting lodge, until it ihould be ready for 
the reception of the family. Mr^ D. in- 
lifted on proceeding to the hunting-lodge. 
Mr. M. ftrenuoufly oppofed the intention, 
and with difficulty prevailed on the thought- 
lefs father and volatile daughter to flop at 

M-^ Houfe, while he went in fearch of 

its abfent lord. It was early in the day when 
they arrived \ and, when Mr. M. had given 
orders for their accommodation, he fet out 
for the lodge. 

From the time the unhappy M. had come 
within fight of thofe fcenes which recalled 
all the recent circumftances of his life to 
memory, his heart had, throbbed with a 

IS • 



THE WILD IRISH GlRLl l6l 

> 

quickened pulfe; even the fcenery of 
M ' ■ Houfe had awakened his emotion ; 
his enforced return thither^ his brief and 
reftlefs refidence there ; and the eager de- 
Kght with which he flew from the defolate 
manflon of his father to the endearing circle 
of Inifmore ; all rufhed to his memory, and 
awakened that train of tender recoliedion 
he had lately endeavoured to ftifle. Happy 
to feize on an occafion of efcaping from the 
reflraint the fociety of his infenfible compa- 
nions impofed, happier dill to have an oppor- 
tunity aflforded him of vifiting the neighbour- 
hood of Inifmore, every flep of his little 
journey to the lodge was marked by the re- 
newed exiftence of fome powerful and latent 
emotion ; and the agitation of his heart and 
feelings had reached their acme by the time 
he had arrived at the gate of that avenue 
from which the mountains of Inifmore were 
difcemible. 

When he reached the lodge, a young 
lad, who was working in the grounds, re- 
plied to his enquiries^ that an old woman 



162 THE WILD IRISH GIRL* 

was its only refident, that the ancient fteward 
was dead, and that Lord M. had only re- 
mained there an hour. 

This laft intelfa'gence overwhelmed 

Mr, M- with aftoniihment. To his 

further enquiries the boy only faid, that, as 
the report went that M Houfe was 

undergoing fome repair, it was probable his 
lord had gone on a vifit to fome of the 
neighbouring quality. — « He added, that His 
Lordihip's own gentleman had accompanied 
him: 

Mr. M ■ remained for a confiderable 
time loft in thought; then, throwing the 
bridle over the horfe's neck, folded his 
arms, and fuflfered it to take its own courfe ; 
it was the fame animal which had fo often 
carried him to Inifmore. When he had 
determined on following his father to the 
lodge, he had ordered a frefli horfe ; that 
which the groom led out was the fame which 

Mr. M had left behind him, and which^ 

by becoming the companion of his fingular 
adventure, had obtained a peculiar intereft 



THE WILD IRISH GIRL. 1 63 

in his affedions. When he had paflfed the 
avenue of the Iddge, the animal inftin£lively 
took that path he had been accuftomed to 
go : his inftind was too favourable to the 
fecret wifhes of the heart of his unhappy 
mailer : he fmiled fadly, and fuffered him 
to proceed. The evenmg. was far advanced 
-^ the fun had funk in the horizon, as from 
an eminence he perceived the caftle of Inif* 
more. His heart throbbed with violence -— 
a thoufand hopes, a thoufand wifhes, a 
thoufand fears, agitated his bread : he dared 
not for the moment liften to the fuggeftions 
of either. Loft in the mufings of his heart 
and imagination, he was already within a 
mile of Inifmore. The world now difap-* 
peared — he defcended rapidly to a wild and 
trackiefs fliore, ikreenedfrom the high road 
by a range of inacceffible cliffs. Twilight 
faintly lingered on the fummit of the moun- 
tains only : the tide was out : and croffing 
the ftrand, he found himfelf beneath thofe 
ftupendous cliffs which fhelter the weftern 
part of the peninfula of Inifmore from the

ocean. The violence of the waves h^ worn 
feveral defiles through the rocks, which 
commanded a near view of thei ruined cq/ile ; 
it was involved in gloom and filence — all 
was dark, ftill, and folemn ! No lights ifiued

intervals the filence of defolation. 

A fecret impulfe ftill impelled the fleps 

of Mr.M ,and the darknefs of the night 

&voured his irrefiflible defire to fatisfy the 
longings of his enamoured heart, by taking 
a lafl look at the fhrine of its ftill worfhipped 
idol. He proceeded cautioufly through the 
rocks^ and, alighting, faflened his hprfe 
near a patch of herbage ; then advanced to* 
wards the chapel— its gates were open — 
the filence of death hung over it. The rifing 
moon, as it fhone through the broken cafe- 
ments, flung round a dim religious light, 
and threw its quivering rays on that fpot 
where he had firfl beheld Glorvina and her 
father engaged in the interefHng ceremonies 
of their religion. And to think that even at 
that moment he breathed the air that (he

refpired, and was within a' few paces of the 
. fpot flie inhabited ! — Overcome by the 
convidion, he refigned himfelf to the deli- 
rium which involved his heart and fenfes ; 
suid, governed by the overpowering impulfe 
of the moment, he proceeded along that 
coionade through which he had diftantly 
followed her and the Prince on the night of 
his firft arrival at the caftle. It feemed to his 
heated brain as though he ftill purfued thofe 
fine and flriking forms which almoft ap- 
peared but the phantoms of Fancy's creation. 
On every mourning breeze he thought 
the found of Glorvina's voice was borne; 
and, ftarting at the fall of every leaf, he 
ahnoft expeded to meet at each ftep the 
form of Father John, if not that of his fiadth- 
lefs miftrefs : but the idea of her lover oc- 
curred not# The review of fcenes fo dear 
awakened only recoUedion of paft enjoy- 
ments ; and in the fond dream of memqiry 
his prefent fufferings were for an interval 
fuipended* 



1 66 THE WILD IRISH GIRL* 

Scarcely aware of the approximation, he 
had already reached the lawn which fronted 
the cattle, and which was ftrewed over with 
fragments of the mouldering ruins ; there, 
leaning behind a broken wall which fcreenod 
him from obfervation, he indulged himfelf 
in contemplating that noble but decayed 
edifice, where fo many of the happieft and 
mott blame] efs hours of his life had been 
enjoyed. His firft glance was direded to- 
wards the cafement of Glorvina's room, 
but there nor in any other did the leaft 
glimmering of light appear. With a faulter- 
ing ftep he advanced from his concealment 
towards the left wing of the cattle, and 
fnatched a hatty glance through the window 
of the banquetting-halL It was the hour 
in which the family were wont to afiemble 
there. It was now impenetrably dark 
— he ventured to approach flill clofer, and 
fixed his eye to the glafs ; but nothing met 
the inquiry of his eager gaze fave a piece of 
armour, on whofe polifhed furface the 
moon's random beams faintly played. His

heart was chilled ; yet, encouraged by the 
filent defolation that furrounded him, he 
ventured forward. The gates of the caftle 
were partly open : the hall was empty and 
dark—- he paufed aAd liflened — all was filent 
as the grave. His heart funk within him^ 
he almoft wifhed to behold fome human 
form, to hear fome human found. On 
either fide the doors of two large apartments 
fiood open : he looked into each ; all was 
chill and dark. 

Grown defperate by gloomy fears, he 
proceeded rapidly up the ftone flairs which 
wound through the centre of the building. 
He paufed; and, leaning over the baluft- 
rade, liftened for a confiderable time ; but, 
whe^ the echo of his footfteps had died 
away, all was again ftill as death. Horror- 
ftruck, yet doubting the evidence of his 
fenfes, to find himfelf thus far advanced in 
the interior of the caftle, he remained for 
fome time motionlefs -— a thoufand melan- 
choly fuggeftions ftruck on his foul. With 
an impulfe almoft fnantic he rufhed to the

corridor. The doors of the feveral rooms 
, on either fide lay open, and he thought by 
the moon's doubtful light they feetned 
defpoiled of their furniture. 

While he flood rapt in horror and amaze^ 
ment, he heard the fpund of Glorvina's harp» 
borne on the blaft which fighed at intervals 
along the paffage. At firft he beliered it 
was the illufion of h& fancy difordered by 
the awful fingularity of his peculiar fitua- 
tion. To fatisfy at once his infupportable 
doubts, he (lew to that room where the 
harp of Glorvina always flood: like t^e 
refl it was unoccupied, and dimly lit up by 
the moon beams. The harp of Glorvina, 
and the cotich on which he bad firfl fat 
by her, were the only articles it con- 
tained: the former was flill breathing its 
wild melody when he entered, but he 
perceived the melancholy vibration was 
produced by the fea-breeze (admitted by 
the open cafement) which fwept at intervals 
along its ftrings. Wholly overcome, he fell 
on the couch — his heart feemed fcarcely 
fufceptible of pulfation — every nerve of his 



THE WILD IRISH GIRL. 1 69 

brain was drained almoft to burfting *— he 
gafped for breath. The gale of the ocean 
continued to figh on the chords of the harp ; 
itis plaintive tones went to his very foul, and 
roufed thofe feelings fo truly in unifon with 
every fad impreffion* A few burning tears 
relieved him from an agony he was no 
longer able to endure; and he was now 
competent to draw fome inference from the ' 
dreadful fcene of defolation by which he 
was furrounded. The good old Prince was 
no more!— or his daughter was married! 
In either cafe it was probable the family had 
deferted the ruins of Inifmore. 

While abforbed. in this heart-rending 
meditation, he faw a faint light gleaming 
on the ceiling of the room, and heard a 
footftep approaching. Unable to move, 
he fat brcathleis with, expectation. An 
ancient female, tottering and feeble, with a 
lantern in her hand, entered; and, having 
fattened down the window, was creeping 
' fiowly along, muttering to herfelf : when fhe 
perceived the pale and ghaftly figure of the

between the fweet felicities of new-born

doubt, the weary traveller reached the 
peninfula of Inifmore about the fame hour

to make his arrival firft known to Father

name and rank, his pai&on for Glorvina, 
and to receive his deftiny from her lips only. 
He had fcarcely entered the chapel, when 
the private door by which it communicated 
with the caftle flew open. He fcteened

Father John proceeding with a foletnn air to* 
wards the altar, followed by the Prince, car-

apparently in the laft ftage of mortal exif« 
tence. Glorvina then appeared wrapt in a 
long veilj and fupported on the arm of a 
ftranger, whofe figure and air was lofty and 
noble, Uut whofe face was concealed by the 
recumbent attitude of his head, which droop-

This fingular proceffion advanced to the

With a ftrong convulfion of expiring 
nature, the Prince ftarted from his chair j 
gazed for a moment on the earl with a 
fixed and eager look, and again fank on 
his feat ; it was the lafl: convulfive throe of 
life, roufed into exiftence by the laft violent 
feeling of mortal emotion. With an un- 
definable expreffion, he direded his eyes 
alternately from the father to the fon, then 
Tank back, and clofed them : the younger 
M. clafped his hand, and bathed it with 
his tears : his daught^, who hung over

back of the Prince's chiir, his face covered 
with his hand : the prieft held his right

attendants there was not one appeared with 
a dry eye. 

After a long and aiFe£ling ptiufe, the 
Prince heaved a deep figh, and raffed his 
eyes to the crucifix which hung over the 
altar : the effufions of a departing and pious 
foul murmured on his lips, but the powers 
of utterance were gone ; every mortaji paf- 
fion was fled, fave that which flutters with 
the laft pulfe of life in the heart of a doat- 
bg father — parental folicitude and paraital 
love. Religion claimed his lafl: fenfe of 
duty, nature his laft impulfe of feeling; 
he fixed his laft gaze on the face of his 
daughter; he raifed himfelf with a dying 
efibrt to receive her iaft kifs : (he fell on his 
foofom — their arms interlaced. In this at- 
titude he expired. 

Glorvina, in the arms of the attendants, 
was conveyed lifelefs to -the caftle. The

The filence of compaffion, of horror, which

her fong of grief, while no eye fave her's

Abruptly breaking off her plaintive drain, 
Ihe drew the veil from her father's face, and 
fiiddenly averting her gaze from his livid

In the courfe of four days, the remiuns 
of the Prince were configned to the tomb. 
Glorvina's health and fine conftitution were 
already prevailing over her diforder and 
acute fenfibility : her fenfes were gradually 
returning, and only appeared fiibjed: to

fufferings of mind and body, was feis^d 
with a flow fever, and confined for many

Recdved into the manfion of the gene- 
rous but incautious Prince as a profcribed 
and unfortunate wanderer, I owed my re- 
ception to his humanity rather than his pru> 
dence ; and, when I told him that I threw 
my life into his power, his honour became 
bound for its fecurity, though his principles 
condemned the conduA which he believed 
had effedied its juft forfeiture. 

For fome months, in two fucceeding fum- 
mers, I contrived to perpetuate with plaufive 
details the myftery I had forged ; and to 
confirm the intereft I had been fo fortunate 
at firft to awaken into an ardent friendfhip, 
which became as reciprocal as it was difin- 
terefted* Yet it was ftill my deftiny to be 
loved identically as myfelf ^ as myfelf adven- 
titioully to be hated. And the name of the 
Earl of M— - was forlndden to be mentioned 
in the prefence of the Prince, while he fre- 
quently confefled that the happieft of his 
hours were paffed in Lord M — 's fociety. 

Thus Angularly fituated, I dared not 
hazard a revelation of my real charader.

precious immunities with which my fidtidous

But, while it was my good fortune thus 
warmly to ingratiate myfelf with the father, 
can I pafs over in filence my prouder tri- 
umph in that filial intereft I awakened in the 
heart of his daughter ! Her tender comlni- 
feradon for my fuppofed misfortunes ; the 
petfevering goodnefs with which fhe en- 
deavoured to refcue me from thofe erroneous 
principles ihe believed the efficient caufe of 
my fufferings, and which I appeared to 
iacrifice to her better reafon ; the flattering

eagemeis with which ihe received thofe in- 
ftruftions it was my fupreme pleafure to 
beftow on her; and the folicitude iheincef*

and, even when I formed the determination^ 
die accompliihment of which you fo unex- 
pededly, fo providentially, fruftrated, the 
gratification of any felfifb wiih, the com* 
pliance with any paffionate impulfe, held no 
influence over the determinatbn. No, it 
was only diftated by motives pure as the 
objed that infpired them ; it was the wifh 
of ihatching this lovely bloflbm from the 
defert where ffae bloomed unfeen ; of rai0ng 
her to that circle in fociety her birth entitled 
her to, and her graces were calculated to 
adorn ; of confirming my amity with her 
father by the tendereft unity of interefts and 
affedions; of giving her a legally iandioned 
ebim on that part of her hereditary pro-

buting the parent through the medium of

zled by his real or fuppofed talents, I viewed 
his future deftiny through the medium of 
my parental ambition,, and thought only^ of 
tbofe means by which he might become 
great, without confidering the more impor* 
tant necei&ty of his becoming happy. Yet, 
well aware of the phlegmatic indifference 
of the one, and the romantic imprudence 
of the other, I denied them my confidence, 
^ntil the final iffue of my final adventure 
would render its revelation neceflary. Nor 
idid I fufped the poifibility of their learning 
it by any other means ; for the one nev^ 
vifited Ireland, and the other, as the fonof 

Lord M , would find no admittance 

to the caftle of Inifmore, 

When a fixed determination fucceeded 
to fome months of wavering indecifion, I 
wrote to Glorvina, with whom I had been 
in habits of epiftolary correfpondence, dif-

sidered with timidity, and faintly demanded

would noM#, until I could claiin her openly

In the interim, however^ I received a 
letter from her, written previous to her re-* 
ceipt of mine. It began thus: ^* In thdie 
happy moments of boundlefs confidence, 
when the pupil and the child hung upon

It is needlefs to add, that I determined to 
anfwer this letter in perfon, and I only 
waited to embrace my loved and longi^ 
eftranged fon on my arrival in Ireland* 
When I fet out for Inifmore, I found the

receptacle of &fiering virtue^ and efieded 
the liberation of the Prince. There woi 
a time when the haughty fpirit of this proud 
chieftain would have revolted againft the 
idea of owing a pecuniary obligadon to any 
man ; but thofe only, who have laboured 
under a long &nd continued feries of mental 
and bodily afflidion, can tell how the mind's 
Ibrength is to be fubdued, the energies of 
pride foftened, and the delicacy of refined 
feelings blunted, by the preffure of re- 
iterated buffering, of haraffing and incef-

claimed in the vehemence of his gratitude,

and her humid eyes beamed on me all the

Remember that you are not placed by

Be cautious how you condemn; be more 
cautious how you deride; but be ever

flame, and terminate in a liquid light, that, 
reverberating in fympathy to its former 
Idndred, genially warms and gratefully 
cheers the whole order of oniverial nature*
